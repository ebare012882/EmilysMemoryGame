# EmilysMemoryGame
Memoire a la francaise

This is a matching game, with pictures that I took in France when living there. 

This game can be shared with former colleagues at ENHS, SFHS, UCO, OCCC, and KSU.

Rules: 
-Player 1:
    -Choose two tiles. If the monuments are a match, you get a point!
-Play goes to player 2
-Player 2:
    -Choose two tiles. If the monuments are a match, you get a point!
-Play goes back to player 2.
-Game continues until all the matches are made and the board is clear.
-How to win: Be the player with the most points!
-To play a new game: press the "Refaire!" Button
-Bonus: (Only include this in the rules if I accomplish the coding!!)
    -When a match is made- identify the monument for an extra point!


User Stories: 
Users should be able to:
-choose two tiles to see the images that are hidden underneath.
-After chosen:  
    -If the tiles are a match, a point shows up in the player's point box and play goes to the next player. 
    -If the tiles are NOT a match, the pictures disappear under the beginning tile image and the next player takes their turn. 
-If I accomplish the bonus I set for myself:
    -Once a match is made, the player gets a chance to answer a multiple choice question about which monument it is. 
-Press a reset button once the game is over to get the board to repopulate.
-Play unlimited games.


Project notes: 
-Will use pictures from my own travels to avoid any copywrite issues. 
-Tiles will have rounded edges. 
-Will need lots of divs.
-Tiles should start with the same "cover image" on each.
-Once chosen, the tile should change to a picture from France.
-Game should recognize if the same two picture tiles are chosen. 
-Will need an array of my images that can be looped over in order to create the board.
-If it's a match, a message should appear "Youpi! Tu as gange un point! Yay! You get a point!"
-Needs a title at the top
-Set a background pic from France.
-Each player gets to choose two tiles per turn.
-Once the game board is cleared of all tiles, players can press a "reset" button ("Refaire") to restart the game.
-At the end of the game, a message should pop up saying "Game over! C'eat fini!"


Bonus (that I set for myself):
-If a match is made:
    - a div box should pop up below the game board with the question: "Qu'est-ce que c'est?" ("What is it?"), with 4 choices, once of which will be the correct answer.
    -if the player answers correctly, they earn a bonus point, which gets tallied in their points box.
