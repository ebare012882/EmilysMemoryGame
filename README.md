# EmilysMemoryGame
Mémoire à la française

This is a matching game, with pictures that I took in France when living there. 

This game can be shared with former colleagues at ENHS, SFHS, UCO, OCCC, OU, and KSU.

## Rules: 
- Player 1:
    - Choose two tiles. If the monuments are a match, you get a point!

- Play goes to player 2

- Player 2:
    - Choose two tiles. If the monuments are a match, you get a point!

- Play goes back to player 2.

- Game continues until all the matches are made and the board is clear.

- How to win: Be the player with the most points!

- To play a new game: press the "Refaire!" Button


## User Stories: 
Users should be able to:
- Choose two tiles to see the images that are hidden underneath.
- After chosen:  
    - If the tiles are a match, a point shows up in the player's point box and play goes to the next player. 
    - If the tiles are NOT a match, the pictures disappear under the beginning tile image and the next player takes their turn. 
<!-- - If I accomplish my stretch goals:
    - Once a match is made, the player gets a chance to answer a multiple choice question about which monument it is.  -->
- Press a reset button once the game is over to get the board to repopulate.
- Play unlimited games.


## Project notes: 
- Will use pictures from my own travels to avoid any copywrite issues. 
- Tiles will have rounded edges. 
- Will need lots of divs.
- Tiles should start with the same "cover image" on each.
- Once chosen, the tile should change to a picture from France.
- Game should recognize if the same two picture tiles are chosen. 
- Will need an array of my images that can be looped over in order to create the board.
- If it's a match, a message should appear "Youpi! Tu as gagné un point! Yay! You get a point!"
- Needs a title at the top
- Set a background pic from France.
- Each player gets to choose two tiles per turn.
- Once the game board is cleared of all tiles, players can press a "reset" button ("Refaire") to restart the game.
- At the end of the game, a message should pop up saying "Game over! C'est fini!"


### Stretch Goals/Version 2 goals:
- If a match is made:
    - a div box should pop up below the game board with the question: "Qu'est-ce que c'est?" ("What is it?"), with 4 choices, once of which will be the correct answer.
    - if the player answers correctly, they earn a bonus point, which gets tallied in their points box.
